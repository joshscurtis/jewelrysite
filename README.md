This project was my first introduction to AngularJS. I learn best by doing so I decided to work on a retail website for the custom jewelry that I make with the help of Blender and Shapeways.

This project was started from [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed). I have removed the testing functionality of the bower and k-something configurations.

Most of the CSS is done with the Bootstrap Framework v3, and is intended to be fully responsive.

Front-end dependency handling is done via bower.

This project is powered on the back-end by the [Moltin ECommerce API](http://moltin.com).

**ToDo**

There is alot left to be done on this code. The use of scope is pretty terrible, as I'm still getting a good grasp of scopes within AngularJS. There is also almost no respectable error-handling on any of the forms or back-end API calls. Additionally I should at some point turn the Moltin API interaction into a Service instead of putting all of that into the module controllers. Also, there is no real copy yet on the site...
